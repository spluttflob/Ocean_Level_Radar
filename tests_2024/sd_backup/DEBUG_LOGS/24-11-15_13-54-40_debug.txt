Input: l
ESP32: 
ESP32: Set the maximum step length. Current value: 06 (15.0 mm)
ESP32: Format: XX
ESP32:  Input must match format exactly. Enter a single integer between 01 and 99, inclusive.
ESP32: Notes:
ESP32:  The maximum step length is set in multiples of 2.5mm. Multiply the inputed setting by 2.5mm to get the maximum step length in mm.
ESP32:  Set the maximum step length to the desired resolution for measuring wave heights.
ESP32:  This is an upper bound - the distance algorithm may return finer resolution measurements.
ESP32:  Keep maximum step length as high as possible. Greatly affects power consumption and maximum possible update rate.
ESP32: Example:
ESP32:  The user wants to determine wave heights accurate to within 5mm.
ESP32:  The user should set the maximum step length to 2, since 2 * 2.5mm = 5mm.
ESP32:  User would enter "2" into terminal with no quotes.
ESP32: 
Input: 08
ESP32: 
ESP32: Maximum step length set to 08 (20.0 mm)
ESP32: Is this the desired value? Type Y for yes, any other character for no.

Input: u
ESP32: 
ESP32: Set the update rate. Current value: 10.0 Hz
ESP32: Format: XX.X
ESP32:  Input must match format exactly. Enter leading and trailing zeros as appropriate.
ESP32:  Value must be between 00.1 and 10.5, inclusive.
ESP32:  Units are in Hertz.
ESP32: Notes:
ESP32:  Keep as low as is required. Greatly affects power consumption.
ESP32: Example:
ESP32:  A measurement is required every 0.2 seconds.
ESP32:  Update rate should be set to 5 Hz.
ESP32:  User would enter "05.0" into terminal with no quotes.
ESP32: 
Input: 08.0
