ESP32: Set the maximum step length. Current value: 08 (20.0 mm)
ESP32: Format: XX
ESP32:  Input must match format exactly. Enter a single integer between 01 and 99, inclusive.
ESP32: Notes:
ESP32:  The maximum step length is set in multiples of 2.5mm. Multiply the inputed setting by 2.5mm to get the maximum step length in mm.
ESP32:  Set the maximum step length to the desired resolution for measuring wave heights.
ESP32:  This is an upper bound - the distance algorithm may return finer resolution measurements.
ESP32:  Keep maximum step length as high as possible. Greatly affects power consumption and maximum possible update rate.
ESP32: Example:
ESP32:  The user wants to determine wave heights accurate to within 5mm.
ESP32:  The user should set the maximum step length to 2, since 2 * 2.5mm = 5mm.
ESP32:  User would enter "2" into terminal with no quotes.

ESP32:  Value must be between 00.10 and 20.00, inclusive.
ESP32:  Units are in meters.
ESP32: Notes:
ESP32:  Generally advised to leave a margin of 0.1m below maximum wave height.
ESP32:  Keep as low as possible. Greatly affects power consumption and maximum possible update rate.
ESP32: Example:
ESP32:  Radar is placed 10m above average wave height, and waves height fluctuates within +/- 1m.
ESP32:  End of measurement range should be set to 1.2m.
ESP32:  User would enter "01.20" into terminal with no quotes.
