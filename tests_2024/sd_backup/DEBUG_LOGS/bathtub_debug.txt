ESP32: Notes:
ESP32:  Measurement profile is used to set the length and shape of the emitted radio pulse.
ESP32:  Higher profiles transmit more energy, increasing signal-to-noise ratio and range.
ESP32:  Keep profile as low as possible. Greatly affects power consumption and maximum possible update rate.
ESP32: Example:
ESP32:  The user starts the radar with maximum profile setting of 2, but can only detect waves half the time.
ESP32:  The user should increase the profile setting by 1, repeating until the waves are always detected.
ESP32:  User would enter "3" into terminal with no quotes.

ESP32:  Measurement profile is used to set the length and shape of the emitted radio pulse.
ESP32:  Higher profiles transmit more energy, increasing signal-to-noise ratio and range.
ESP32:  Keep profile as low as possible. Greatly affects power consumption and maximum possible update rate.
ESP32: Example:
ESP32:  The user starts the radar with maximum profile setting of 2, but can only detect waves half the time.
ESP32:  The user should increase the profile setting by 1, repeating until the waves are always detected.
ESP32:  User would enter "3" into terminal with no quotes.

ESP32: Example:
ESP32:  The user starts the radar with maximum profile setting of 2, but can only detect waves half the time.
ESP32:  The user should increase the profile setting by 1, repeating until the waves are always detected.

ESP32: Notes:
ESP32:  Measurement profile is used to set the length and shape of the emitted radio pulse.
ESP32:  Higher profiles transmit more energy, increasing signal-to-noise ratio and range.
ESP32:  Keep profile as low as possible. Greatly affects power consumption and maximum possible update rate.
ESP32: Example:
ESP32:  The user starts the radar with maximum profile setting of 2, but can only detect waves half the time.
ESP32:  The user should increase the profile setting by 1, repeating until the waves are always detected.
ESP32:  User would enter "3" into terminal with no quotes.

ESP32: Notes:
ESP32:  The maximum step length is set in multiples of 2.5mm. Multiply the inputed setting by 2.5mm to get the maximum step length in mm.
ESP32:  Set the maximum step length to the desired resolution for measuring wave heights.
ESP32:  This is an upper bound - the distance algorithm may return finer resolution measurements.
ESP32:  Keep maximum step length as high as possible. Greatly affects power consumption and maximum possible update rate.
ESP32: Example:
ESP32:  The user wants to determine wave heights accurate to within 5mm.
ESP32:  The user should set the maximum step length to 2, since 2 * 2.5mm = 5mm.
ESP32:  User would enter "2" into terminal with no quotes.

ESP32: P: Change the maximum measurement profile. Affects power consumption, update rate, and accuracy.
ESP32:    Current value: 3
ESP32: Q: Change the signal quality. Affects power consumption, update rate, and accuracy.
ESP32:    Current value: 15.0

ESP32: X: Exit the menu.
ESP32: 
Input: q
ESP32: 
ESP32: Set the signal quality. Current value: 15.0
ESP32: Format: XX.X
ESP32:  Input must match format exactly. Enter leading and trailing zeros as appropriate.
ESP32:  Value must be between 00.0 and 35.0, inclusive.
ESP32:  Units are arbitrary.
ESP32: Notes:
ESP32:  Higher signal quality results in a higher signal-to-noise ratio target, and increases the number of averages
ESP32:  taken for a single datapoint. This generally increases the accuracy of measurements.
ESP32:  Keep as low as possible. Affects power consumption and maximum possible update rate.
ESP32: Example:
ESP32:  The user starts the radar with signal quality setting of 15.0, but measurements appear inaccurate.
ESP32:  The user should increase the profile setting by 1.0, repeating until the measurements are accurate enough.
ESP32:  User would enter "16.0" into terminal with no quotes.
ESP32: 
Input: 35.0
ESP32: 
ESP32: Signal quality set to 35.0
ESP32: Is this the desired value? Type Y for yes, any other character for no.
