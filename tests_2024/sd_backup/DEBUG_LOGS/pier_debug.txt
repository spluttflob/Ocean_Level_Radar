ESP32:  Input must match format exactly. Enter a single integer between 1 and 5, inclusive.
ESP32:  Units are arbitrary.
ESP32: Notes:
ESP32:  Measurement profile is used to set the length and shape of the emitted radio pulse.
ESP32:  Higher profiles transmit more energy, increasing signal-to-noise ratio and range.
ESP32:  Keep profile as low as possible. Greatly affects power consumption and maximum possible update rate.
ESP32: Example:
ESP32:  The user starts the radar with maximum profile setting of 2, but can only detect waves half the time.
ESP32:  The user should increase the profile setting by 1, repeating until the waves are always detected.
ESP32:  User would enter "3" into terminal with no quotes.
ESP32: 
Input: 3
ESP32: 
ESP32: Maximum profile set to 3
ESP32: Is this the desired value? Type Y for yes, any other character for no.

ESP32: Notes:
ESP32:  Measurement profile is used to set the length and shape of the emitted radio pulse.
ESP32:  Higher profiles transmit more energy, increasing signal-to-noise ratio and range.
ESP32:  Keep profile as low as possible. Greatly affects power consumption and maximum possible update rate.
ESP32: Example:
ESP32:  The user starts the radar with maximum profile setting of 2, but can only detect waves half the time.
ESP32:  The user should increase the profile setting by 1, repeating until the waves are always detected.
ESP32:  User would enter "3" into terminal with no quotes.
ESP32: 
Input: 1

ESP32: Set the maximum step length. Current value: 04 (10.0 mm)
ESP32: Format: XX
ESP32:  Input must match format exactly. Enter a single integer between 01 and 99, inclusive.
ESP32: Notes:
ESP32:  The maximum step length is set in multiples of 2.5mm. Multiply the inputed setting by 2.5mm to get the maximum step length in mm.
ESP32:  Set the maximum step length to the desired resolution for measuring wave heights.
ESP32:  This is an upper bound - the distance algorithm may return finer resolution measurements.
ESP32:  Keep maximum step length as high as possible. Greatly affects power consumption and maximum possible update rate.
ESP32: Example:
ESP32:  The user wants to determine wave heights accurate to within 5mm.
ESP32:  The user should set the maximum step length to 2, since 2 * 2.5mm = 5mm.
ESP32:  User would enter "2" into terminal with no quotes.
ESP32: 
Input: 02
ESP32: 
ESP32: Maximum step length set to 02 (5.0 mm)

ESP32:  Higher profiles transmit more energy, increasing signal-to-noise ratio and range.
ESP32:  Keep profile as low as possible. Greatly affects power consumption and maximum possible update rate.
ESP32: Example:
ESP32:  The user starts the radar with maximum profile setting of 2, but can only detect waves half the time.
ESP32:  The user should increase the profile setting by 1, repeating until the waves are always detected.
